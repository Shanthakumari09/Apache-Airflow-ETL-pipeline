# Apache-Airflow-ETL-pipeline
This repository is for building robust and automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using the powerful combination of Apache Airflow and Python! We're not just moving data, we're orchestrating a symphony of information flow. 🎶

## 🏁  Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone this masterpiece:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArpitKadam/airflow-etl-pipeline.git
    ```

2.  **Install the necessary dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd airflow-etl-pipeline
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Fire up Docker (Optional, but Highly Recommended):**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Spin up your PostgreSQL (or chosen database) instance and make sure it's ready for the data influx.
     _Note_: Consider testing database connection.

## 🕹️ Let's Play: Using the Pipeline

1.  **Launch the Airflow Webserver:**
    ```bash
    airflow webserver -p 8080
    ```
    _Visualize_: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. Welcome to your Airflow control center!

2.  **Start the Airflow Scheduler:**
    ```bash
    airflow scheduler
    ```
    _Behind the Scenes_: This is the engine that will trigger your scheduled data workflows.

## 🗺️ Pipeline Workflow: 

This pipeline follows the classic ETL approach:

1.  **Extract**: We extract data from a source (you can customize the source in the DAG!). This source could be a file, an API, or another database. It's like the "mining" phase of our data operations.
2.  **Transform**: Raw data is transformed into a more useful format, cleaned, and processed. This involves data cleaning, aggregations, filtering, etc. This is our "gem polishing" stage.
3.  **Load**: The transformed data is loaded into the target database. It's like setting the final polished gem into the data storage.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack: The Tools of the Trade

*   **[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)**: The conductor of our data orchestra. Airflow schedules and monitors the execution of our ETL workflows, ensuring everything runs smoothly and on time.
*   **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**: Our versatile programming language. We use Python to define the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) that represent our ETL process, as well as the individual transformations. 🐍
*   **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**: Our reliable shipping container for the entire application stack. Docker guarantees consistency, whether you're running locally or on a server.
*   **[PostgreSQL (or Your Database of Choice)](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Our destination for the cleaned and transformed data. This is where our data gems will be stored, ready for use. 🗄️
*   **[Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/)**: (Optional) The cloud-based solution for scaling and managing Airflow deployments. Think of it as the 'big stage' for your data's performance.
* **[Jinja Templating](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/)**: Jinja is used to dynamically create DAG configurations based on time or environment variables.
